    The Ship is a subclass of GameElement, which means it is updatable,
    participates in collisions, and is drawable on the game screen.

    Because it is a GameElement, it has a rect attribute which has x and y
    positions as well as all the standard pygame.rect attributes like
    topleft and center.

    The x and y positions are always defined in pixels and refer to the top
    left corner of the image. The x and y values are always relative to the
    top left corner of the game screen itself, which is defined to be at
    x=0, y=0.

    The Ship also has a velocity which is a Vector2 value in pixels per
    millisecond (ppm), with a unit vector pointing 1 ppm to the right and
    1 ppm down (â†˜).

    Initially, there is only ever one ship in the game. However, this class
    is written to allow for a multiplayer option in the future.
