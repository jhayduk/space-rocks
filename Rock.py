class Rock(GameElement):
    """
    Rock is a subclass of GameElement, which means it is updatable,
    participates in collisions, and is drawable on the game screen.

    Because it is a GameElement, it has a rect attribute which has x and y
    positions as well as all the standard pygame.rect attributes like
    topleft and center.

    The x and y positions are always defined in pixels and refer to the top
    left corner of the image. The x and y values are always relative to the
    top left corner of the game screen itself, which is defined to be at
    x=0, y=0.

    A Rock also has a velocity which is a Vector2 value in pixels per
    millisecond (ppm), with a unit vector pointing 1 ppm to the right and
    1 ppm down (â†˜).

    When a Rock is first instantiated, is starts off at a random size (small,
    medium, or large), and at a random location. Each time it gets hit, it
    breaks into multiple smaller rocks. Once the smallest rock is hit, it is
    removed from the game.
