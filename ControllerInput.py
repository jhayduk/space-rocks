ControllerInput

This class is intended to capture controller input from the user in a unified
manner so there is one place from which to get information about what the user
is trying to do, regardless of the method (e.g. keyboard, joystick, trackball)
being used.

This class is a singleton so that it can be accessed from multiple locations
without having to pass the single instance around everywhere.

This class is specific for the space-rocks game.
